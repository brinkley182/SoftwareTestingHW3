# SoftwareTestingHW3

This is all done using a maven build

This DateObj program is designed to handle all valid dates as well as a method nextDate() to increment the dates by one day. If the day
shifts the month or year the program should implement it properly.

The tester file for this is designed to test the edge cases as well as normal invalid dates to pinpoint what may be working incorrectly in the program.
